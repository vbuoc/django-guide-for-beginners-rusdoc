# Введение

> Оригинал: https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/2017/09/04/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-django-part-1.html

Welcome to the second part of our Django Tutorial! In the previous lesson, we installed everything that we needed. Hopefully, you are all setup with Python 3.6 installed and Django 1.11 running inside a Virtual Environment. We already created the project we are going to play around. In this lesson, we are going to keep writing code in the same project.

In the next section, we are going to talk a little bit about the project we are going to develop, so to give you some context. Then after that, you are going to learn all the Django fundamentals: models, admin, views, templates, and URLs.

Hands on!

<h4 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h4>

<p>In this tutorial, we explored many new concepts. We defined some requirements for our project, created the first models,
migrated the database, started playing with the Models API. We created our very first view and wrote some unit tests.
We also configured the Django Template Engine, Static Files, and added the Bootstrap 4 library to the project. Finally,
we had a very brief introduction the Django Admin interface.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed the second part of this tutorial series! The third part is coming out next week, on Sep 18, 2017.
In the next part, we are going to explore Django’s URL routing, the forms API, reusable templates, and more testing. If
you would like to get notified when the third part is out, you can <a href="http://eepurl.com/b0gR51" target="_blank">subscribe to our mailing list</a>.</p>
