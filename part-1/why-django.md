# Почему Django?

Django is a Web framework written in Python. A Web framework is a software that supports the development of dynamic Web sites, applications, and services. It provides a set of tools and functionalities that solves many common problems associated with Web development, such as security features, database access, sessions, template processing, URL routing, internationalization, localization, and much more.

Using a Web framework, such as Django, enables us to develop secure and reliable Web applications very quickly in a standardized way, without having to reinvent the wheel.

So, what’s so special about Django? For starters, it’s a Python Web framework, which means you can benefit from wide a range of open source libraries out there. The Python Package Index repository hosts over 116K packages (as per 6 of Sep. 2017). If you need to solve a specific problem, the chances are someone has already implemented a library for it.

Django is one of the most popular Web frameworks written in Python. It’s definitely the most complete, offering a wide range of features out-of-the-box, such as a standalone Web server for development and testing, caching, middleware system, ORM, template engine, form processing, interface with Python’s unit testing tools. Django also comes with battery included, offering built-in applications such as an authentication system, an administrative interface with automatically generated pages for CRUD operations, generation of syndication feeds (RSS/Atom), sitemaps. There’s even a Geographic Information System (GIS) framework built within Django.

The development of Django is supported by the Django Software Foundation, and it’s sponsored by companies like JetBrains and Instagram. Django has also been around for quite some time now. It’s under active development for more than 12 years now, proving to be a mature, reliable and secure Web framework.

## Кто использует Django?

It’s good to know who is using Django out there, so to have an idea what you can do with it. Among the biggest Web sites using Django we have: Instagram, Disqus, Mozilla, Bitbucket, Last.fm, National Geographic.

For more examples you can see the Django Sites database, they offer a list of over 5K Django-powered Web sites.

By the way, last year, in the Django Under The Hood 2016 conference, Carl Meyer, a Django core developer, and Instagram employee, gave a talk on how Instagram use Django at scale and how it supported their growth. It’s a one hour talk, but if you are interested in learning more, it was an entertaining talk.
