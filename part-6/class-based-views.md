#### Introduction

Welcome to the sixth part of the tutorial series! In this tutorial, we are going to explore in great detail the Class-Based Views. We are also going to refactor some of the existing views so to take advantage of the built-in Generic Class-Based Views.

There are many other topics that we are going to touch with this tutorial, such as how to work with pagination, how to work with Markdown and how to add a simple editor. We are also going to explore a built-in package called Humanize, which is used to give a “human touch” to the data.

Alright, folks! Let’s implement some code. We have plenty of work to do today!

#### Conclusions

With this tutorial, we finalized the implementation of our Django board application. I will probably release a follow-up implementation tutorial to improve the code. There are many things we can explore together. For example, database optimizations, improve the user interface, play with file uploads, create a moderation system, and so on.

The next tutorial will be focused on deployment. It’s going to be a complete guide on how to put your code in production taking care of all the important details.

I hope you enjoyed the sixth part of this tutorial series! The last part is coming out next week, on Oct 16, 2017. If you would like to get notified when the last part is out, you can [subscribe to our mailing list](http://eepurl.com/b0gR51).
