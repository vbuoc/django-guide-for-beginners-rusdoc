<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>

<p>Welcome to the 5th part of the tutorial series! In this tutorial, we are going to learn more about protecting views
against unauthorized users and how to access the authenticated user in the views and forms. We are also going to
implement the topic posts listing view and the reply view. Finally, we are going to explore some features of Django
ORM and have a brief introduction to migrations.</p>

<h4 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h4>

<p>In this tutorial, we made some progress in the development of the Web boards functionalities. There are a few things
left to implement: the edit post view, the “my account” view for the user to update their names, etc. After those two
views, we are going to enable markdown in the posts and implement pagination in both topic listing and topic replies
listing.</p>

<p>The next tutorial will be focused on using class-based views to solve those problems. And after that, we are going to
learn how to deploy our application to a Web server.</p>
