<h4 id="domain-name">Domain Name</h4>

<p>If we are going to deploy a Django application properly, we will need a domain name. It’s important to have a domain
name to serve the application, configure an email service and configure an https certificate.</p>

<p>Lately, I’ve been using <a href="https://namecheap.pxf.io/c/477033/386170/5618" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Namecheap</a>
a lot. You can get a <strong>.com</strong> domain for $8.88/year, or if you are just trying things out, you could register a <strong>.xyz</strong>
domain for $0.99/year.</p>

<p>Anyway, you are free to use any registrar. To demonstrate the deployment process, I registered the
<a href="https://www.djangoboards.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.DjangoBoards.com</a> domain.</p>
