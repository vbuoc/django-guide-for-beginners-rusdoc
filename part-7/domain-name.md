#### Domain Name

If we are going to deploy a Django application properly, we will need a domain name. It’s important to have a domain name to serve the application, configure an email service and configure an https certificate.

Lately, I’ve been using [Namecheap](https://namecheap.pxf.io/c/477033/386170/5618) a lot. You can get a **.com** domain for $8.88/year, or if you are just trying things out, you could register a **.xyz** domain for $0.99/year.

Anyway, you are free to use any registrar. To demonstrate the deployment process, I registered the [www.DjangoBoards.com](https://www.djangoboards.com/) domain.
