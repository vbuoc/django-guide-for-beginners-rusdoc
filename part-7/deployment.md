#### Introduction

Welcome to the last part of our tutorial series! In this tutorial, we are going to deploy our Django application to a production server. We are also going to configure an Email service and HTTPS certificates for our servers.

At first, I thought about given an example using a Virtual Private Server (VPS), which is more generic and then using one Platform as a Service such as Heroku. But it was too much detail, so I ended up creating this tutorial focused on VPSs.

Our project is live! If you want to check online before you go through the text, this is the application we are going to deploy: [www.djangoboards.com](https://www.djangoboards.com).

Even though this was the last part of the tutorial series, I plan to write a few follow-up tutorials exploring other interesting topics as well, such as database optimization and adding more features on top of what we have at the moment.
